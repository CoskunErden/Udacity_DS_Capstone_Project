# Udacity Data Science Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Capstone, focusing on analyzing customer behavior using simulated Starbucks data. The goal is to determine how different demographic groups respond to various types of offers and develop strategies to target customers more effectively.

## Key Components
- **portfolio.json**: Offer details (type, difficulty, reward, duration).
- **profile.json**: Customer demographic information (age, gender, income).
- **transcript.json**: Customer transaction and interaction data (offers received, viewed, completed).

## Objective
- Analyze customer interactions with offers.
- Build models to predict responses based on demographics.
- Create a strategy for sending targeted offers to customers.

## Future Work
- More detailed analysis and model results will be added later.
- Instructions for setup and running the project will be included.
